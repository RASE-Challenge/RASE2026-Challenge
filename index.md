## About

The **RASE 2026 Challenge** at **ICASSP 2026** focuses on speech enhancement from **mmWave radar** data through glass barriers. Participants will receive radar-microphone paired data, develop enhancement models, and compete for top rankings.

---

## Dataset

Radar signals are recorded using the **TI AWR2243 mmWave radar**. The challenge includes 3 difficulty levels:

- **Loudspeaker diaphragm** (simplest case)  
- **Secondary surface vibrations** (moderate)  
- **Laptop screen in a virtual meeting setup** (most challenging)

Paired microphone recordings are provided in `.wav` format. No radar signal processing experience is required.

---

## Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated using:

- **PESQ** – Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality  
- **ESTOI** – Extended Short-Time Objective Intelligibility  
- **DNSMOS** – Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score  
- **MFCC Cosine Similarity**

The final score is **difficulty-weighted**:  
Easy (25%) + Medium (35%) + Hard (40%)

---

## Baseline

Baseline deep learning models (in PyTorch) will be provided to help participants get started. These include:

- Spectral feature mapping networks  
- Phase-aware enhancement models  
- Preprocessing/postprocessing pipelines

📦 **Baseline release date**: September 07, 2025
